<h3 id="overview-of-the-book">Overview of the book</h3>
<p>Welcome to “Mastering C: The Power of Advanced Programming.” In this
chapter, we’ll embark on a journey to explore the intricacies of
advanced C programming and uncover the untapped potential that this
versatile language offers.</p>
<p>C, renowned for its simplicity and efficiency, has been a stalwart in
the programming world since its inception. However, its true power lies
in the hands of those who master its advanced features. In this section,
we’ll delve into the significance of advancing beyond the basics and
harnessing the full potential of C.</p>
<p>C has evolved over the years, and with each iteration of the language
standard, new features and capabilities have been introduced. From its
humble beginnings to the present day, C has played a pivotal role in
shaping the foundations of modern computing. This chapter will guide you
through the historical context of C and set the stage for an in-depth
exploration of its advanced features.</p>
<p>While C is often celebrated for its low-level capabilities, its
advanced features are sometimes overlooked. Advanced C programming opens
doors to intricate control flow mechanisms, memory manipulation, and
efficient data structures. As we progress through this book, you’ll
discover how to wield these tools effectively, enabling you to write
more robust, efficient, and maintainable code.</p>
Before we dive into the technical details, let’s take a brief tour of
what this book has to offer.
<p>The first part of the book lays the groundwork, covering essential
concepts such as advanced control flow, pointers, memory management, and
advanced data structures. By mastering these foundational elements,
you’ll be well-equipped to tackle more complex programming
challenges.</p>
<p>In the second part, we explore advanced techniques such as function
pointers, macros, file handling, and multi-threading. These chapters
provide practical insights into writing versatile and efficient
code.</p>
<p>The third part takes a hands-on approach, demonstrating how advanced
C programming is applied in real-world scenarios. We’ll delve into
GNU/Linux kernel programming, network programming, and embedded systems
development.</p>
<p>Part four is dedicated to best practices and optimization. Learn how
to write secure code, optimize performance, and ensure your C programs
run smoothly.</p>
<p>The fifth part delves into metaprogramming, code generation, C++
interoperability, and the latest C standards. These chapters explore the
cutting edge of C programming, providing you with the tools to stay at
the forefront of technology.</p>
<p>In the final part, we’ll recap the key concepts, provide additional
resources for further learning, and encourage you to continue your
journey.</p>
<p>C is mostly considered as a relatively low-level programming language
among plenty of high-level programming languages. So why do we choose
such a relatively low-level language? This is partly because its freedom
for users. The evolution of modern languages are limiting the usage of
some basic language structs like GOTO, pointers, manually memory
management, etc. These are considered powerful but maliculus features,
for these features may lead to complex bugs and some serious problems.
But this doesn’t means that these tools are bad. In contrast, they are
powerful tools. There are many schemes in modern programming languages
that banned the usage of GOTO but replaced it with more reasonable
language features, structures and more. This makes it easier to write
programs with more robustness, but have less choices when getting into
some big troubles.</p>
<p>But, if you are using C, you can totally build your own language
structures, schemes, etc. (Lisp can also do this, but this is not the
topic of this book) This book will summarize some schemes(a.k.a black
magics) that implemented in C, because pointer, GOTO and struct in C are
all we need.</p>
<p>This part only covers a basic part of C, for more detailed
introduction, there are plenty of better choices if you are a beginner
of C.</p>
<p>大概就是出版物的常见格式都给显示一遍吧。</p>

<p>高级控制流这东西，现在最常见的基本都是对于GOTO和Loop的封装。现代语言在汇编的判断和有/无条件跳转指令的基础上，创造了许多封装完善，符合直觉的控制流结构。根据实际需要，在C中也可以实现更为强大和复杂但完善的控制流。而控制流的来源大多数时候是来源于实际和灵感，也来自对于现有代码的分析，抽象和形式化。下面会讲几种C中几种比较少见的控制流。有的是从其他语言抄来的，有的是对于现实的建模。</p>
