# Part I: Foundations of Advanced C Programming
## Introduction to Advanced C Programming
### Overview of the book
#### Overview
Welcome to "Mastering C: The Power of Advanced Programming." In this chapter, we'll embark on a journey to explore the intricacies of advanced C programming and uncover the untapped potential that this versatile language offers.

##### Why Advanced C Programming Matters

C, renowned for its simplicity and efficiency, has been a stalwart in the programming world since its inception. However, its true power lies in the hands of those who master its advanced features. In this section, we'll delve into the significance of advancing beyond the basics and harnessing the full potential of C.

##### The Evolution of C
C has evolved over the years, and with each iteration of the language standard, new features and capabilities have been introduced. From its humble beginnings to the present day, C has played a pivotal role in shaping the foundations of modern computing. This chapter will guide you through the historical context of C and set the stage for an in-depth exploration of its advanced features.

##### Unleashing the Full Potential
While C is often celebrated for its low-level capabilities, its advanced features are sometimes overlooked. Advanced C programming opens doors to intricate control flow mechanisms, memory manipulation, and efficient data structures. As we progress through this book, you'll discover how to wield these tools effectively, enabling you to write more robust, efficient, and maintainable code.

##### What Awaits You in This Book
Before we dive into the technical details, let's take a brief tour of what this book has to offer.
- Foundations of Advanced C Programming
The first part of the book lays the groundwork, covering essential concepts such as advanced control flow, pointers, memory management, and advanced data structures. By mastering these foundational elements, you'll be well-equipped to tackle more complex programming challenges.

- Advanced Techniques and Strategies
In the second part, we explore advanced techniques such as function pointers, macros, file handling, and multi-threading. These chapters provide practical insights into writing versatile and efficient code.

- Real-world Applications
The third part takes a hands-on approach, demonstrating how advanced C programming is applied in real-world scenarios. We'll delve into GNU/Linux kernel programming, network programming, and embedded systems development.

- Best Practices and Optimization
Part four is dedicated to best practices and optimization. Learn how to write secure code, optimize performance, and ensure your C programs run smoothly.

- Advanced Topics in C
The fifth part delves into metaprogramming, code generation, C++ interoperability, and the latest C standards. These chapters explore the cutting edge of C programming, providing you with the tools to stay at the forefront of technology.

In the final part, we'll recap the key concepts, provide additional resources for further learning, and encourage you to continue your journey.

##### Why using C?
C is mostly considered as a relatively low-level programming language among plenty of high-level programming languages. So why do we choose such a relatively low-level language? This is partly because its freedom for users. The evolution of modern languages are limiting the usage of some basic language structs like GOTO, pointers, manually memory management, etc. These are considered powerful but maliculus features, for these features may lead to complex bugs and some serious problems. But this doesn't means that these tools are bad. In contrast, they are powerful tools. There are many schemes in modern programming languages that banned the usage of GOTO but replaced it with more reasonable language features, structures and more. This makes it easier to write programs with more robustness, but have less choices when getting into some big troubles.

But, if you are using C, you can totally build your own language structures, schemes, etc. (Lisp can also do this, but this is not the topic of this book) This book will summarize some schemes(a.k.a black magics) that implemented in C, because pointer, GOTO and struct in C are all we need.

##### Basics of C
This part only covers a basic part of C, for more detailed introduction, there are plenty of better choices if you are a beginner of C.

大概就是出版物的常见格式都给展示一遍吧。

## Advanced Control Flow

这部分从发展历史来讲述控制流，并介绍一些控制流的特殊用法。
### Goto statements and their use cases

现如今所有的控制流基本都源自汇编中的无条件转移和条件转移。但是goto正如汇编一样，阅读难度大，维护难度也大，对于程序员的心智负担较重，因此之后的控制流都在尝试使用其他更受控，更直观的控制流来让我们更受控地使用goto。想直观理解为啥要这么做的话，某弹幕游戏的ECL脚本就是一个不错的例子。它的条件/非条件转移全部使用goto实现， 因此难以阅读和编写。

### Structured programming principles
### Advanced control flow mechanisms
高级控制流这东西，现在最常见的基本都是对于GOTO和Loop的封装。现代语言在汇编的判断和有/无条件跳转指令的基础上，创造了许多封装完善，符合直觉的控制流结构。根据实际需要，在C中也可以实现更为强大和复杂但完善的控制流。而控制流的来源大多数时候是来源于实际和灵感，也来自对于现有代码的分析，抽象和形式化。下面会讲几种C中几种比较少见的控制流。有的是从其他语言抄来的，有的是对于现实的建模。

#### 谁说C不能try-catch的
你可曾听说过一种GOTO实现的异常处理？没有？那你用过Golang没？

```c
int main(void) {
    
```

#### 这怎么不叫闭包，你就说是不是闭的吧
#### 看好了，switch是这么用的
#### Python的while if else组合，C也可以做到的哦
#### GOTO不削能玩？
#### 循环怎么你了
#### 及时刹车：你猜高德纳为啥讨厌GOTO
